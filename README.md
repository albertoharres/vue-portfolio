# Single page Portfolio with vue.js

This project was created with two ideas in mind: Learn vue.js and create an easy to use portfolio site that artists could use. I saw a lot of my artist friends hard terrible sites and I wanted to help them out.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

`npm install` install dependencies

`npm install vue --save` incase you don't already have vue installed

`npm run dev` run the site

`npm run build` build the site

## Tools used for the build

- [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader)
- [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)
- [Avalanche](http://colourgarden.net/avalanche/)
- [Lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)

## Work to do

- [x] Switch from using the css lightbox to a js based one.
- [ ] Revamp the CSS. (Did some, still needs work though)
- [x] Automate 'work' page better - now it is several steps to add a picture.
- [x] Make it possible to add custom footer with work info for all pictures.
